After cloning from git:
1) install npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

`npm i -D path webpack webpack-merge webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
npm i-D webpack-merge-and-include-globally webpack-watch-files-plugin

# **Global TODO's**

1) Change all coordinate calculations to more clean matrix/vector transformations
2) Change the import system to more modern function/lib per file approach.
